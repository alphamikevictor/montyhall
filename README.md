Monty Hall
==========

Perform a simulation of the monty hall problem to really check if it is better to swap or not on the Monty Hall Problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

Currently you can download the project and run in your local browser (Firefox, Chrome and IE8 tested).

You can perform an interactive game on Interactive tab, or run simulations in the Simulation tab.

You can see it in action at http://montyhall.quieroganarlaprimitiva.com
